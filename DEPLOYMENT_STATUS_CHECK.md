# 🔄 Deployment Status Check

**Last Deployment Triggered:** Just now (commit 58ca3ea)

## Current Status: 🟡 DEPLOYMENT IN PROGRESS

I'm monitoring your GitHub Actions deployment to see if the Supabase secrets issue has been resolved.

## What I'm Checking:

1. **GitHub Actions Workflow Status**
   - Build job completion
   - Deployment job completion
   - Any errors in the workflow

2. **Supabase Integration**
   - Whether the "Error: supabaseKey is required" is resolved
   - If the site loads properly with database connectivity

3. **Live Site Verification**
   - Test https://mahfuzulislam873.github.io/M873/
   - Check browser console for errors

## Next Steps:

**If deployment succeeds** ✅:
- Test the live site functionality
- Verify Supabase authentication works
- Confirm all features are operational

**If deployment fails** ❌:
- Check GitHub Actions logs for specific errors
- Verify Supabase secrets are properly configured
- Troubleshoot any remaining issues

## Manual Verification:

You can check the deployment status yourself:
1. Go to https://github.com/mahfuzulislam873/M873/actions
2. Look for the latest "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow run
3. Check if it shows a green checkmark ✅

Let me know when you see the deployment complete and I'll verify the site is working properly!
